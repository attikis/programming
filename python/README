INSTALLING
----------

FeynHiggs, SLHAlib, SUSYHIT and CPsuperH are installed (assuming the current working directory is Top2HPlus) by typing:

cd workspace && make install


GETTING RESULTS: FeynHiggs
--------------------------

SUSYHIT is using the mass-spectrum calculated by FeynHiggs, so FeynHiggs has to always be run first. This is done by typing (assuming now that the working directory is Top2HPlus/workspace, from this on, this is always assumed unless otherwise indicated):

make FH_plot

This creates root macros to directory

Top2HPlus/workspace

and the FeynHiggs input and output parameters are stored in files in directory

Top2HPlus/data


GETTING RESULTS: SUSYHIT
------------------------

As mentioned above, SUSYHIT uses the mass spectrum calculated by FeynHiggs. Therefore the SUSYHIT input files are generated by typing:

cd ../src && python readFH.py

This creates the SUSYHIT input files into a directory specified in readFH.py. After that, SUSYHIT is run simply by typing:

make SH_plot

Root macros and input/output parameters are saved into same directories as with FeynHiggs.


GIVING DIFFERENT INPUT PARAMETERS
---------------------------------

Values of used input parameters for looping FeynHiggs are set in file

Top2HPlus/src/FH_interf.py

-Plots can be obtained with branching ratios as functions of either tanB, Mhp or MA0.

-The variable on the x-axis is selected in FH_interf.py by setting the value of variable SWITCH. Possible values are:

"mhp, "Ma0" and "tanB".

-Values of those parameters are defined in lists:

tanBList, mA0List, MhpList and muList.

-When SWITCH="mhp" or "mA0", variable outer_loops should be given value tanBList. This means, that for every value of mhp or mA0, FeynHiggs is run with all the different balues of tanB in tanBList.

-Similarly, when SWITCH="tanB", outer_loops should be given value of either mA0List or MhpList.

All the other input parameters are defined in file

Top2HPlus/src/demo_p.cc

NOTICE THAT FOR ANY CHANGES TO TAKE EFFECT, ONE SHOULD ALWAYS TYPE

make cleanall && make install

AND THEN RUN THE NEEDED PROGRAMS AGAIN!
