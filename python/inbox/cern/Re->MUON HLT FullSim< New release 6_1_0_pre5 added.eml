Hi Jason,

I said that the two releases were similar within statistical 
uncertainties. I meant that the level of disagreement between the two 
releases (in this case due to HLT/RECO since the events were recycled) 
was at the level of the statistical fluctuations you would expect given 
the statistics in these samples.
