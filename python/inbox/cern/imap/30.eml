Subject: infn postdoc fellowships

Hello Sasha, Vladimir & Olga,
unrelated to the PAS for once :-)

Do you know of any good CMS member that might be interested to work (in CMS) in Pisa in
the next two years.
http://www.ac.infn.it/personale/exp_fellowships/
Do to tax regulations these fellowships are essentially tax-free so the salary is very
good for italian standards.
It's a bit last minute (deadline november 20th) but in case you know a good CMS
candidate searching for a postdoc let me know !
They are 2-year post-doc contracts with a starting date in 2013, no later than Nov
1st. 
A student currently completing his thesis can apply but by the starting day the PhD
thesis must have been defended.

Cheers
Paolo
