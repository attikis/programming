*** Discussion title: Dataset Bookkeeping System

as suggested at CompOps moving I am moving this thread
to WM list. This is likely too much work for me to slip
it in myself as done with all bug fixes in last years.

probably 1 week FTE including testing.
Possibly even someone not very familiar with
crab internals could do with a (very) crude hack.
A crude hack may be better anyhow since I fear
a clean solution would touch many parts and
require a very extensive testing.
What at least Federica and myself usually lack
is the possibility to be full time on anything
for that long, once you look into the 1 week FTE to be
spread in 4 weeks or more schedules tend to slip.
Which is why I resisted tackling this so far.
Should we get DMWM involved ?
