Dear CMS Collaborators,

The registration to the course "Using Physics Analysis Toolkit (PAT)
in your analysis" is open from today. You can find the registration
form and course schedule at
https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=217169<https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=187161&gt;
The course will take place 3 - 7 Dec, 2012 at CERN.

It will consist of an intense period of lectures, exercise sessions,
one-to-one discussions and examples on the use of PAT in a concrete
physics analysis. As the name says, the course will give an overview
of the available physics analysis tools and the skills will be put in
practice during the exercise sessions for which each
participant is required to have an analysis project in mind. It is
very unlikely that you will come out with a completed analysis after a
one-week course but we consider it important to have a real analysis
scenario in mind for effective learning.

To make best profit of the course and the tutoring, you should
reserve a substantial amount of your time for it during the tutorial
week.

Participants with little or no prior knowledge on CMSSW or
otherwise are expected to finish a set of pre-requisite exercises
before starting the PAT tutorial so as to be fully prepared.
Experience and feedback from the participants has shown that finishing
pre-requisite exercises helps participants do well in the course. The
pre-requisite exercise material will be available by 20 Nov, 2012.
A persistent communication and discussion forum will be associated to
them as to the whole course. We strongly recommend to every participant
to do all pre-exercises and to contact the tutors via the discussion forum (or in person)
in case of problems. The successful completion of the pre-requisite exercises is
a measure of your own computing abilities and an important ingredient
to make maximal use of the following PAT tutorial.

To estimate the number of tutors and to organize the course, we
would like you to register as soon as possible.
Please note that to assure the successful tutoring during the exercise
sessions, the number of participants is limited to 25. We would like
to minimize the number of no-shows and hence expect commitment to
attend the tutorial, once registered.

regards,

                         Sudhir Malik and Felix Höhle (for PAT Team)
