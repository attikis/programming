Dear Colleagues,

The CMS Data Analysis School (CMSDAS) is designed to help CMS physicists fr=
om across the collaboration to learn, or to learn more, about CMS analysis =
and thereby to participate in significant ways in discovery.

This hands-on can do school has been popular and successful. In 2012, our f=
irst global year, schools were held at FNAL, Pisa and Taipei. Links to the =
past schools are here:

https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=3D176245

Each year junior and senior attendees alike said it was the best school of =
its type they had experienced.
More than 240 CMS students have now participated in the program. This email=
 serves to announce the first two CMSDAS schools of 2013: at FNAL and Hambu=
rg.
The format for each CMSDAS is very similar and some of the same facilitator=
s attend each school. CMS members from all regions are welcome to FNAL and =
Hamburg. We are hoping for the same kind of stand out success in 2013 we ha=
ve had with earlier CMSDAS.
For all 2013 CMSDAS the emphasis is on Higgs and new physics.

Registration:

Each school starts with a morning devoted to inspirational plenary talks.  =
The essential features of the school are the execution of a series of short=
 and long exercises. The short exercises  (several hours duration) cover al=
l of the objects from jets to muons and many techniques from event generato=
rs to setting upper limits occur during the first half of the school. Each =
student chooses six.   In the second half of the school detailed physics me=
asurements are performed with the CMS data set (the long exercises) in a 2.=
5 day intensive period by focused teams of about 6-8 students. The long exe=
rcises in 2013 will range from standard model cross sections to new physics=
: SUSY, exotica and Higgs. Both the short and long exercises are designed a=
nd facilitated by teams of 2-3 CMS experts. Some long exercises go beyond t=
he current state of the art of the corresponding CMS analysis thereby offer=
ing a finite chance for discovery at the school. Some past students became =
plugged in to a CMS measurement through a long exercise at the school and t=
hen went on to be part of the CMS measurement team on the paper.

The exercises become part of the CMS software Guide and are supported after=
 the event by the CMS PAT team benefiting many beyond those that attend the=
 school. In these ways the CMSDAS contributes to building CMS.

Prior to the school attendees complete pre-School exercises introducing CMS=
SW, DBS, fitting, etc. which ensures a fast start at the event. The pre-Sch=
ool exercises have been described by some attendees as a very effective int=
roduction to CMS software and have been used widely on CMS.

The cost to attend the school is

at LPC $200
at Hamburg 150 Euros

The organizers are:
Kerstin Borras (DESY)
Hartmut Stadie (Hamburg)
Thomas Schoerner-Sadenius (DESY)
Ian Shipsey  (Purdue)
Rick Cavanaugh (UIC/FNAL)
Sudhir Malik (UNL)

Space is limited so sign up for CMSDAS@LPC and CMSDAS@Hamburg today!

Best,

Joe Incandela
