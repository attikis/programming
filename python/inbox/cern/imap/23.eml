*** Discussion title: Particle Flow 

Hello,

I find some events that contain PFCandidates in the particleFlow
collection with 4-momentum being "nan". For example the index=13
particle in run 1, lumi block 39594, event number 11875853 in the
following MC dataset:

   /TT_CT10_TuneZ2star_8TeV-powheg-tauola/Summer12_DR53X-PU_S10_START53_V7A-v2/AODSIM  

Here is a skim of this one event:

   /afs/fnal.gov/files/home/room3/sakoay/public/TT_CT10_TuneZ2star_8TeV-powheg-tauola_1_39594_11875853w.root

I'm not sure if this is to be expected, just that it seems rather odd to
me and I have to write guards in my code against it. Perhaps some expert
can comment?

Regards,

Sue Ann Koay sakoay@cern.ch
