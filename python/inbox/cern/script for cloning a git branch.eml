Subject: script for cloning a git branch
Content: Dear all,
The script for cloning a branch is now available in
http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~slehti/Higgs
and should be placed somewhere in path (like $HOME/bin/)

The name is Higgs (short of HiggsAnalysis), but if you come up with a 
better name let's rename it. There is now a security addition, if no 
argument is set it will give usage+list of available branches.

I'm going to clean up my public repo a bit, and delete the following 
branches:
   CMSSW_342
   CMSSW_3X
   cmssw311x
   hpstanc
   pattuplev26
   pattuplev6
   pattuplev7
   rework
   tctau
   trigger
Any objections?

Cheers,
Sami
