Hi, reading this thread I want to reinforce Maurizio's main point. If
there is a new resonance at 145 GeV, then it is not a SM Higgs.
Therefore we know absolutely nothing a priori about its decays,
production, or total width. So certainly we cannot start combining
channels treating it like a SM Higgs. Just as for, e.g., a SUSY search,
we should do single channel analyses and not get excited until we
approach 5 sigma in a single channel. -Joe Lykken
