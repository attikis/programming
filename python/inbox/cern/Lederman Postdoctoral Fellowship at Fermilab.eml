LEON M. LEDERMAN Postdoctoral FELLOWSHIP at FERMILAB

The Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) invites applications for the Lederman Postdoctoral Fellowship in experimental particle physics. The Lederman Fellow will work within the broad program of experimental research at Fermilab, which includes research at the LHC, neutrino physics, particle astrophysics and experiments at the Intensity Frontier. In recognition of Leon Lederman's outstanding career in research and his commitment to the teaching of physics, we are looking for candidates who have demonstrated exceptional ability in research and who also wish to participate in physics outreach for a fraction of their time.

The Lederman Fellowship is a three year appointment with a possible extension. Candidates should have obtained a Ph.D. in experimental particle physics, astrophysics, or a closely related field after November 1, 2011, or should expect to obtain a Ph.D. in the same fields by September 2013.

Applications including curriculum vitae, a description of prior research, a statement of research interests, and details of experience and interest in outreach should be sent to LMLFAPP@fnal.gov. Applicants should also arrange for three or four references to be sent to the same e-mail address. Applications and their references should be received by December 10, 2012.

Fermilab is an Equal Opportunity Employer M/F/D/V
