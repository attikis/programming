Dear all,

some HCP talks from CMS speakers have been selected for central rehearsal.
The rehearsals will happen in two sessions, trying to minimise overlap with approval talks:

Thursday morning from 11:30 to 13:30:
https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=216328
and Friday afternoon from 15:00 to 17:30
https://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=216331

The indico pages contain the EVO coordinates (password is HCP2012).
Physical rooms at CERN will be listed also in the indico pages as soon as confirmed.

Please attend the rehearsal with your comments so to help our speakers!

Best,
        -CGL
