Abstract:
A number of theories beyond the standard model predict the production of events with one charged lepton and one neutrino. This letter describes the search for such events with the CMS detector using 3.7 fb-1 of pp collisions at sqrt(s)=8 TeV. No evidence is found for any excess of events above the standard model expectation. Therefore limits are derived on the parameters of several theories. The results are interpreted in terms of a sequential standard model heavy charged gauge boson (W'), a split universal extra dimension model, and a contact interaction model. For a W' with standard-model-like couplings masses below 2.85 TeV are excluded at 95% confidence level.

The target journal is PRD-RC.
