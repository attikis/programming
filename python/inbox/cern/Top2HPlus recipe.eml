In case you want to change something, here is the recipe
git clone http://cmsdoc.cern.ch/~slehti/Top2HPlus.git
cd Top2HPlus/workspace
edit ../src/FH_inputMaker.py to select the masses and tanb's
make FH (runs FH for all the points selected in FH_inputMaker.py)
make FH_root (creates the root file from FH txt output created in the 
previous step))

The FH version is controlled by the first line of the Makefile.

Cheers,
Sami
